# Advent of Code 2018

These are my solutions to the [2018 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/).
I'm mostly OK with them, I think there are a few that could use a bit more optimization
but this was all just a bit of fun after all!

If you want to run these yourself, you'll need Python installed for starters. The requirements
file should include all the packages you need to run my solutions. The one tricky thing
would be if you want to create the videos (using the handy `--video`) flag!) for the simulations,
which will require that you have `ffmpeg` on the command line. Enjoy!
